## About DOOM mobile PHP

DOOM mobile PHP is a DOS game built on top of Tauri and heavily influenced by NativePHP. This mobile application uses Laravel InertiaJS Vue3 Typescript Tailwindcss and Tauri, only.

It uses JS-DOS to emulate the DOS engine. And DOOM is hosted on a CDN.

I always wanted to play DOS games on my mobile phone without the use of Steam or online platforms.
It was possible before, but now it is easy, it took me a lot more days.
